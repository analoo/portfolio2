                        <p>
                            Front-End Developer with 5+ years of experience building simple and intuitive tools for
                            HR
                            departments. Recent graduate with a certificate UC Berkeley extension school with skills
                            in
                            CSS, Javascript, HTML, [placeholder]. A passion for people is at the core of everything
                            that I do
                            - both
                            my focus of analytics within HR, cross team collaboration and user experience. I am a
                            creative
                            problem solver who sees beyond individual projects and tasks to see how work fits into
                            the
                            bigger
                            picture. In my most recent role, I saw a gap in performance data. I quickly leveraged
                            google
                            sheets
                            and query functionality to make a database that was used as a temporary employee
                            performance
                            management system. This emphasis on execution often means that I am seen as a team
                            player
                            and a go
                            to person for collaboration and resolving issues. I also have a high bar for quality and
                            want to
                            make magic for end users. I am consensus driven and often focus on creating minimum
                            viable
                            products
                            quickly to ensure that end users and stakeholders can provide feedback early and often.
                            I am
                            most
                            excited by big, challenging problems which I approach with calmness and good
                            organizational
                            skills.
